      One of my favourite video games I've ever playes is
      <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Valorant</a>, a
      competitive team-based first person shoooter. The gameplay revolves around
      trying to plant or defuse a bomb that the attacking team will put on a
      site.

      My favourite sport by far is rock climbing. Not only does it train your
      strenght and flexibility, but there is also an endless amount of things
      you can do in it. Climbing walls are fully customizable, allowing you to
      do whatever you want with them, challenging yourself to whatever extent
      you wish to. Personally, I enjoy bouldering at a local rock gym,

    <h3>Pizza</h3>

      My favourite food has to be pizza. It tastes really good, and comes in a
      variety of styles, such as pepperoni, cheese, neapolitan, and many more.
      My personal favourite has to be the classic pepperoni pizza. Pineapple pizza sucks by the way. Some common ingredients found in pizza are:
      <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.costco.com/whole-wheel-parmigiano-reggiano%2C-72-lbs.-.product.100096211.html" target="_blank">Cheese</a></li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Some sort of topping</li>
      </ul>
